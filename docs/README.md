# Wechat Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their Wechat credentials at this HumHub installation. 
A new button "Wechat" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Wechat instructions](https://github.com/yavish/humhub_auth-wechat) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **AppID** and **AppSecret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Wechat Auth -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in Wechat in the corresponding field.
